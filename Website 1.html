		Enjoying Martial Arts
	</h3>
	<h4> As I think about it more, I realize martial arts has been among my all-time favorite activities/hobbies/passions.  It’s my best source of stress relief.  I started as a kid, around 3rd grade, when I went to my first Karate dojo.  Local instructors would come to my school and show us cool stuff to hook us into paying a large amount of money to learn how to make karate noises and kick good, with a dash of “stranger danger” training.  Eventually my dojo closed, and I stopped for a few years.  But I never stopped trying to learn new things, and after getting to college I found another outlet to continue martial arts.  It reminded me how much I missed it.

				<li> As I learned it, martial arts was not an invitation to go out and attack people indiscriminately.  It was meant to give the tools to protect your life, and if necessary, the life of another. I also took my knowledge to competitions, in order to test my skills and earn trophies/medals.

			<q> Martial arts is about honor and respect.
